        <form action="action_page.php"><!--NOTE: 'action' attribute, (which should always be in the opening tag of 'form') determines the action that follows when users click submit after filling out the form. you also have to create a php file with the same name(action_page). on the php file, you'll need to write some more instructions that users will read or follow once they get there.-->
<!--the one created by eniola on start.ng-->
            <label for="fname">First Name:</label><!--basic xplanation for this is that you use it to label your input. i.e, the title to your box/field. ensure your 'for' conforms with the 'id' that follows. actually, it really doesn't matter, but I guess for best practice and maybe it'll be needed in your CSS-->
            <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><!--the 'input' element allows you to design the box/field where users will input their information-->
            <p><label for="Lname">Last Name:</label><!--the same explation given in 'fname' goes for this as well.-->
            <input type="text" id="Lname" name="Lname"></p><!--NOTE:between fname and lname, i changed <br> to <p> cuz, with <br>, the boxes were clashing into each other-->
            <input type="radio" id="male" name="gender" value="male"><!--the 'radio' type of input allows to create a multiple choice field where users get to pick only one option out of severals-->
            <label for="male">Male</label><!--so, just like we know already, the label is to add title to our box/field. this is to direct users to know what information to supply in each box/field-->
            <input type="radio" id="fmale" name="gender" value="fmale"><!--NOTE: take out 'radio' and your page will be messed up-->
            <label for="fmale">Female</label>
            <p><input type="submit" value="submit"></p> <!-- thought 'type' should be button but it didn't rnder what I wanted. so I guess there's a type that is 'submit' even though, VScode doesn't suggest it for us.-->

        </form>
        <!--the one created by xyluz on discuss. this he did in an article-->
        <form action="processform.php" method="POST"> <!-- according to xyluz, the opening tag of the 'form' contains 2 attributes. ('action' and 'method') the 'action' specifies where the form should submit (or send) its content to. if this action is not specified, info filled in will be submited on the same page. the method attribute specifies how you want the form submitted.
            we have (GET and POST) the 'GET'=the content of the form submitted will not be exposed to the browser URL. 'POST'= the browser displays the content of the form-->
            <!--a php code needs to be written in a file 'processform.php' so when people click 'submit', they find what to do next or more information...-->
            <p>First Name:<input type="text" name="first_name" placeholder="Enter your First Name" /></p><!--the name attribute will be used by the php to know which content belongs to each field of the contact form-->
            <p>Last Name:<input type="text" name="last_name" placeholder="Enter your Last Name" /></p>
            <p>Email:<input type="text" name="emai" placeholder="Enter Your Email" required /></p>
            <p>Phone Number<input type="number" name="phone_number" placeholder="Enter Your Phone Number" required /></p><!-- we have ('required', 'readonly', disabled') 'required' doesn't allow form to submit until it's filed. 'readonly' makes the content on form readable but cannot be edited by the user. 'disabled' it disables the form element. the diff between this nd readonly is that, if one submits in readonly, it stils submits, 
                but disabled will not submit any content filled.
                if we want to make our phone number and email compulsory such that the form will not submit till thery're filled out, we'll just add 'required' just before closing the tag. as seen in the code here. so this is just a basic validation which can be bypassed...it's not enough. you'll find out how to make it standard later-->
            <!--there's also a <textarea> tag, which allows for mor than one line texts. it's not a self closing element.-->
            <p>Female<input type="radio" value="female" name="gender" />
             Male <input type="radio" value="male" name="gender"></p>
            <p>Comment:<textarea> </textarea></p>
            <button type="submit"> Send Message</button>
